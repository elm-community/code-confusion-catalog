# Code Confusion Catalog

This repo catalogs painful and confusing interactions with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).
We do this to distill a whole lot of confusion down to a handful of solutions.

If that sounds weird to you, watch [*Code is the Easy Part* by Evan Czaplicki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSjbTC-hvqQ&list=PLglJM3BYAMPH2zuz1nbKHQyeawE4SN0Cd&index=1) for more context.

## Should I Open an Issue?

If you're looking for help, you're probably better off asking on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/), or in the #beginners or #general channel on [the Elm Slack](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).
When you do that, your problem will probably be addressed and solved.

If your issue is a good example a confusion we're collecting, someone will direct you back here.
Super!
Go ahead and [open a new issue](https://github.com/elm-community/code-confusion-catalog/issues/new) and fill out the template there.

## When should I Send Someone Here?

Generally, when someone has encountered a difficult pattern that works but could be better. The rules are still loose at the moment - but may be more exact soon.
If in doubt, ask in #elm-community or #elm-dev on [Slack](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).
